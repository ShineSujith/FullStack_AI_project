1. Show me how to set up a VSCode Python project called FullStackProject1 containing main.py which uses a virtual environment to call a function called play() in play_ground.py

2. I have S@p500 stock data for 25 years in csv files in a directory called "stocks"; the files contain the following columns: Date, Close, Adj Close, High, Low, Open, Volume, Ticker. Process all stocks in the directory. Set a variable called theYear to 2024. For each trading day in theYear, check if: - the adjusted close is at least 30% below the 100-day moving average on that trading day (RSI). - when prices touch the lower band (bollinger bands), RSI takes priority. - If a stock meets these criteria, create a buy signal for that trading day. Create a sell signal when any one of these conditions is met on a later trading day: - the adjusted close is at least 70% above the 100-day moving average on that trading day (RSI). - when prices touch the lower band (bollinger bands), RSI takes priority. For each stock that meets the buy and sell criteria at least once, put the following into a dataframe: - stock ticker, - buy date, - buy price, - the adjusted close percentage below the 100-day moving average when the buy signal was created, - sell price, - sell date, - percentage gain, - number of trading days between buy and sell. Sort the df by buy date and save to a csv file called theYear_perf.csv. Then, for each of these stocks, plot the: - theYear adjusted close prices, - buy and sell signals, - 100-day moving average. Show buy and sell signals as vertical dashed lines. Put the images in a directory called plots. Put the code in a function called play(). Before creating the code, outline precisely what you intend to do
